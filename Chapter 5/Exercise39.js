// *5.39 (Financial application: find the sales amount) You have just started a sales job 
// in a department store. Your pay consists of a base salary and a commission. The 
// base salary is $5,000. The scheme shown below is used to determine the commis
// sion rate.
// Sales Amount Commission Rate
// $0.01–$5,000   8 percent
// $5,000.01–$10,000  10 percent
// $10,000.01 and above  12 percent
//   Note that this is a graduated rate. The rate for the first $5,000 is at 8%, the next 
// $5000 is at 10%, and the rest is at 12%. If the sales amount is 25,000, the com
// mission is 5,000*8%+5,000*10%+15,000*12%=2,700.
// Your goal is to earn $30,000 a year. Write a program that finds the minimum sales 
// you have to generate in order to make $30,000.
